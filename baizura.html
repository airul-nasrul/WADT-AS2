            Hi there! Welcome to my page and I will share about me and my work experiences before I attend to Politeknik Brunei. My name is Baizura Abu Bakar. I am from Bukit Sibanging, Tanah Jambu. Before I attend Politeknik Brunei, I was from IBTE college.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back to early 2015, before I attended at IBTE Sultan Saiful Rijal Campus, I have volunteered as Assistant Teacher for Pre-School at Anggerek Desa Primary School for 2 months. I volunteered this job, it is because I like kids and also I like to teach them. The range of their age is around 5 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2017, I was at Muara Port Department. This year was my attachment year as IBTE student. When I was at Muara Port, there is a lot of new thing that IT. My attachment was only in three months. Eventhough it was only three months but the IT staff at Muara Port Department are really friendly and we are like family. In addition, there were two foreigner from India. They taught me how to do berthing of the ship. But they were not so long in Brunei Darussalam because of their contract with their agency.   
        </p>
        <p>
            After I graduated from IBTE College, I have joined the volunteered for Golden Jubilee at Radio Television Brunei. This volunteered was only in three months. I joined this volunteered because I want to get more experience in IT course. My job at RTB was the same as at Muara Port Department, which is try to connect the internet by using command prompt. In RTB, I was paired by my junior at IBTE college but she was in course Engineering.
